Bandora is a project that attempts to make it easier to find music on [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com). It does this by combining elements of reccomendation radio sites like [Pandora](http://pandora.com) or [Last.fm](http://last.fm). 

The project is currently hosted on my webspace [here](http://csh.rit.edu/~schriver/bandora)
